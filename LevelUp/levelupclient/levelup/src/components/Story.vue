          >The hunt for mytholigical treasure is about to begin.... In the year
          1503, a war broke out between the Kingdom of Zomorin(Samoothiri),
          Calicut and the Kochi Raja. The ruthless Samoothiries, with menancing
          army tore into the enemy land without breaking a sweat, and looting
          everything precious they could get thier hand upoun. However, the
          Kochi Raja had a secret plan - his friends from Portugese. Despite
          having the upper hand, the Samoothiris, on hearing about the arrival
          of a Portuguse fleet under Francisco and Afonso de Albuquerque, had to
          retreat. Myths tells us that Samoothiris didn't take back the entire
          plundered treasure. Instead they hid half the treasure at different
          places across the land that raised between Gokarana and Kanyakumari
          when Parushuram threw his blood stained axe. And years later, the
          treasure still lies undiscovered. Now its your chance to rediscover
          the riches of Kochi's glory days. Do you have it in you to uncover the
          hidden clues and discover the great treasure ?? Join the mordern day
          warrior's as they make their quest to unearth the hidden
          treasure.</v-col
