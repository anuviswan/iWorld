    Kochi Raja. Despite having the upper hand, the Samoothiris, on hearing about
    the arrival of a Portuguse fleet under Francisco and Afonso de Albuquerque,
    had to retreat. Myths tells us that Samoothiris didn't take back the entire
    treasure looted by them. Instead they hid half the treasure at different
    places across the land that raised between Gokarana and Kanyakumari when
    Parushuram threw his blood stained axe. And years later, the treasure still
    lies undiscovered. Now its your chance to rediscover the treasure. Do you
    have it in you to uncover the hidden clues and discover the great treasure
    ?? Join the mordern day warrior's as they make their quest to unearth the
